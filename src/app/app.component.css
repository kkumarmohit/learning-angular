/* VIEW ENCAPSULATION
 Angular restricts the css defined with respect to a component to the 
component itself (and not apply it globally - say a css property to p html element)
It does this by assigning a unique add on to css elements which makes each
element of a component unique w.r.t to other element of an another component */

/* In Angular 8+, the @ViewChild() syntax which you'll see in the next lecture needs to be changed slightly:

Instead of:

@ViewChild('serverContentInput') serverContentInput: ElementRef;
use

@ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static: true}) serverContentInput: ElementRef; */
